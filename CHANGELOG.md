 # Change log

Represents the **NuGet** versions.

## v1.0.11
- *Enhancement:* Updated the `EventOutboxEnqueueBase` and `EventOutboxDequeueBase` to include the `EventDataBase.Key` value/column.
- *Enhancement:* Added the `EventOutboxHostedService` (migrated from `NTangle`) to enable hosted outbox publishing service execution.
- *Enhancement:* `LoggerEventSender` updated to also log event metadata.

## v1.0.10
- *Enhancement:* Loosened `EntityCollectionResult` generic `TEntity` constraint to `EntityBase` to enable inherited extended entitites.
- *Enhancement:* Extended `TypedHttpClientBase<TSelf>` to support `DefaultOptions` and `SendOptions` to enable default configuration of new `TypedHttpClientOptions`; i.e. the likes of `WithRetry` can now default versus having to be set per invocation of `SendAsync`.
- *Enhancement:* Added `TypedMappedHttpClientBase`, `TypedMappedHttpClientCore` and `TypedMappedHttpClient` with new `IMapper` property used to add extended support for request and response type mappings as part of the request. New methods are `GetMappedAsync`, `PostMappedAsync`, `PutMappedAsync` and `PatchMappedAsync` where applicable.
- *Enhancement:* `IConverter<T>` usability improvements; including others that leverage.
- *Enhancement:* AutoMapper converters added for common `IConverter<T>` implementations to enable.
- *Enhancement:* `ReferenceDataOrchestrator.ConvertFromId(object? id)` overload added to enable usage when `Type` of `Id` is unknown.
- *Enhancement:* Added `RefDataLoader` overload that supports stored procedure command usage.
- *Enhancement:* Extended `TableValuedParameter` to support standard list types; including corresponding configurable `DatabaseColumn` names.
- *Enhancement:* Add `DatabaseCommand.SelectMultiSetAsync` overloads to support paging. 
- *Enhancement:* Added `IEntityKey` to enable key-based support in a consistent and standardized manner; refactored `IIdentifier` and `IPrimaryKey` to leverage; existing references within updated to leverage `IEntityKey` where applicable.
- *Enhancement:* Improved validation handling of nullable vs non-nullable types when adding rules.
- *Enhancement:* `EntityBase` usage simplified especially where inheriting indirectly, i.e. from a base class that inherits `EntityBase`. As a result `EntityBase<>` will be deprecated next version. `ICloneable` support removed, now supported via `ExtendedExtensions.Clone<T>()`.
- *Enhancement:* Improved the `HttpArg` query string output support.
- *Enhancement:* Added `Models.ChangeLog` (does not inherit from `EntityBase`) as alternative to `Entities.ChangeLog` (which does). Also, added corresponding `AutoMapper` mapping between the two.
- *Enhancement:* `CosmosDbContainerBase` updated to further centralize functionality, inheriting classes updated accordingly.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: `ICollectionResult.Collection` renamed to `ICollectionResult.Items`.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: `IReferenceDataCollection` properties `AllList` and `ActiveList` renamed to `AllItems` and `ActiveItems` respectively.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: `HttpClientEx` removed as was a duplicate of `TypedHttpClient`; the latter was/is the intended implementation.
- *Enhancement:* `JsonDataReader` when loading `IReferenceData` will attempt to read using both JSON and .NET Property names before overridding to allow additional flexibility within the specified JSON/YAML.
- *Enhancement:* `ReferenceDataOrchestrator` concurrency support improved to ensure loading of reference data items for a	`Type` is managed with a `SemaphoreSlim` to ensure only a single thread loads (only once).
- *Fixed:* `SettingsBase` was not looking for keys containing `__` or `:` consistently.
- *Fixed:* `JsonFilterer` implementations now filters contents of a JSON object array correctly.

## v1.0.9
- *Enhancement:* Ported and refactored CosmosDb components from _Beef_ repo.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: Replaced `DatabaseArgs.Paging` with `DatabaseQuery.Paging` and `DatabaseQuery.WithPaging`.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: Replaced `EfDbArgs.Paging` with `EfDbQuery.Paging` and `EfDbQuery.WithPaging`.
- *Enhancement:* Added `JsonDataReader` to enable dynamic loading of either YAML or JSON formatted data for data migration/uploading.
- *Enhancement:* Added `WebApiExceptionHandlerMiddleware` to manage any unhandled exceptions.
- *Enhancement:* Added `TypedHttpClient` to enable basic support for instantiating a `TypedHttpClientCore` without having to explicitly inherit.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: HealthChecks project deprecated with functionality moved to individual projects where applicable.
- *Enhancement:* Added `EfDbEntity` to provide a typed entity wrapper over the `IEfDb` operations.
- *Enhancement:* `AddAzureServiceBusClient` has had support to configure `ServiceBusClientOptions` added.
- *Fixed:* The `ServiceBusMessage` cannot be sent due to local transactions not being supported with other resource managers/DTC resolved.
- *Fixed:* The `AuthenticationException` and `AuthorizationException` HTTP status codes were incorrect; updated to `401` and `403` respectively.

## v1.0.8
- *Enhancement:* `InvokerBase<TInvoker, TArgs>` has been updated to that the `TArgs` value is optional.
- *Enhancement:* `ReferenceDataFilter` added to simplify HTTP Agent filtering as a single encapsulated object.
- *Enhancement:* `WebApi.ConvertNotfoundToDefaultStatusCodeOnDelete` property added to convert `NotFoundException` to the default `StatusCode` (`NoContent`) as considered an idempotent operation; defaults to `true`.
- *Enhancement:* `PropertyExpression.SentenceCaseConverter` added to enable overridding of default `ToSentenceCase` logic.
- *Fixed:* `HttpArg` where `HttpArgType.FromUriUseProperties` was incorrectly formatting string values.
- *Fixed:* `WebApi.Patch` operation was not returning the updated value correctly.
- *Fixed:* `WebApiExecutionContextMiddleware` not setting `Username` and `Timestamp` correctly.
- *Fixed:* `WebApiInvoker` was not setting the `x-error-type` and `x-error-code` headers for `IExtendedException` exceptions.
- *Fixed:* `WebApiParam` updated to use `ETag` header (primary) then `IETag.ETag` property (secondary) as request `ETag` value.
- *Fixed:* `ValidationException` updated to return message as `MediaTypeNames.Text.Plain` where message only (i.e. no property errors).
- *Fixed:* `IChangeLog` values set correctly for `IDatabase` and `IEfDb` create and update.
- *Fixed:* `IDatabase` connection open override methods now called correctly.
- *Fixed:* `CollectionRuleItem<TItem>` updated to support duplicate checking by `IIdentifier<T>` as well as the existing `IPrimaryKey`.

## v1.0.7
- *Fixed:* Invokers updated to leverage `async/await` correctly.

## v1.0.6
- *Enhancement:* Added `WithTimeout(TimeSpan timeout)` support to `TypedHttpClientBase` to enable per request timeouts.
- *Enhancement:* Added `AddFluentValidators<TAssembly>` to automatically add the requisite dependency injection (DI) configuration for all validators defined within an `Assembly`.
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: Refactored the extended entities to simplify implementation and improve experience via new `EntityBase.GetPropertyValues` and corresponding `PropertyValue`. 
- *Enhancement:* Ported and refactored validation framework from _Beef_ repo.
- *Enhancement:* Added support for `IReferenceData` serialization where only the `Code` is serialized/deserialized. This also required new `IReferenceDataContentJsonSerializer`, `ReferenceDataContentJsonSerializer` and `ReferenceDataContentWebApi` for when full `IReferenceData` content serialization is required.
- *Enhancement:* Serializers updated to support `ICollectionResult` which by default only (de)serializes the underlying `Collection`. The `Paging` is expected to be handled separately.
- *Enhancement:* Ported and refactored _core_ database framework components from _DbEx_ rep.
- *Enhancement:* Ported and refactored extended database and entity framework components from _Beef_ repo.
- *Enhancement:* Added implementation agnostic `IMapper` for typed value mappings. Added _AutoMapper_ implementation with wrapper to enable.

## v1.0.5
- *Enhancement:* Overloads added to `WebApi` and `WebApiPublisher` to allow the body value to be passed versus reading from the `HttpRequest`. This is useful where allowing the likes of the ASP.NET infrastructure to deserialize value directly.
- *Enhancement:* Automatic `ETag` generation is performed prior to field filtering as this is considered a post response action and should not affect `ETag` value.
- *Enhancement:* Added `EventSendException` to provide a standard means to capture the events not sent to enable additional processing of those where required.

## v1.0.4
- *Enhancement:* Status code checking added to `TypedHttpClientBase<TSelf>`.
- *Enhancement:* Added `IValidator<T>` to enable any implementation (agnostic); created wrappers to enable `FluentValidation` (including dependency injection helper).
- *Enhancement:* Added `AcceptsBodyAttribute` to enable Swagger (via `AcceptsBodyOperationFilter`) to output body type characteristics where not explicitly defined.
- *Enhancement:* Added opt-in simulated concurrency (ETag) checking/generation to `WebApi.PutAsync` and `WebApi.PatchAsync` where underlying data source does not support.
- *Enhancement:* Added `CancellationToken` to all `Async` methods.

## v1.0.3
- *Enhancement:* `IIdentifier.GetIdentifier` method replaced with `IIdentifier.Id`. The `IIdentifier<T>` overrides the `Id` property hiding the base `IIdentifier.Id`.
- *Enhancement:* `ValueContentResult` properties are now all get and set enabled. The `Value` property has been removed as it is JSON serialized into `Content`.
- *Fixed:* `ValueContentResult.ETag` generation enhanced to handle different query string parameters when performing an HTTP GET for `IEnumerable` (collection) types.
- *Enhancement:* Added `HttpClientEx` as a light-weight means to instantiate a one-off instance from an `HttpClient`.
- *Enhancement:* Added `JsonMergePatch` (`application/merge-patch+json`) whereby the contents of a JSON document are merged into an existing object value as per [RFC7396](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396).
- *Enhancement:* Added/updated reference data capabilities.
- Plus, many more minor fixes and enhancements.

## v1.0.2
- *Enhancement:* **Breaking change**: The event publishing (`IEventPublisher`) is now designed to occur in three distinct phases: 1) formatting (`EventDataFormatter.Format`), 2) serialization (`IEventSerializer.SerializeAsync`), and 3) sending (`IEventSender.SendAsync`). The `EventPublisher` has been added to orchestrate this flow.
- *Enhancement:* Updated the `IJsonSerializer` implementation defaults to align with the expected default serialization behavior.
- *Fixed:* The `TypedHttpClientBase` fixed to handle where the `requestUri` parameter is only a query string and not a path.

## v1.0.1
- *New:* Initial publish to GitHub/NuGet.
